To deploy the static website on your local machine for testing, you have to
install jekyll with the specific version. It can be done with the command:

      gem install jekyll -v 2.4.0
      gem install jekyll-sitemap -v 0.6.1
      gem install bundler

With `jekyll` installed, other dependancies could be installed by running
the command `bundle install` in the folder containing this file.

Host it on the localhost
